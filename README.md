# 🦁 ProjectHobbIt

Hey there! **ProjectHobbIt** is a habit tracker I built because I grew tired of apps that couldn't accommodate my actual work style. It's mobile-first, lets you track things with real numbers (not just checkboxes), and gives you a satisfying GitHub-style heatmap to see your year at a glance.

## ✨ What Makes It Different

### 📊 Analytics That Actually Matter

I wanted to see my progress over time without drowning in charts, so I built:

* **Yearly Heatmap** – Think GitHub contributions, but for your life. Flip between years (2024-2026) to see how you've been doing.
* **The Numbers That Count** – Your longest streak and total active days, front and center.
* **Visual Progress** – Pie charts and trend lines that make sense at a glance.
* **Smart Rankings** – The app figures out which habits you're crushing and which need attention.

### 🎯 Track How You Actually Think

Not everything is yes/no, right? That's why you can:

* **Simple Checkboxes** – For stuff like "Read for 30 minutes" (done or not done).
* **Actual Numbers** – Track things like "Drink 2000ml of water" and get credit for partial progress.
* **Break It Down** – Nest sub-tasks under habits (like Gym → Warmup, Cardio, Weights) because some goals have steps.

### 📱 Built for Your Phone

I designed this thinking about how you'd actually use it:

* **Feels Like an App** – Everything's sized right for thumbs, not mouse cursors.
* **Jumps to Today** – The heatmap scrolls to the current date automatically on mobile.
* **No Annoying Pop-ups** – I disabled those copy/paste menus on buttons so it feels smooth.

### 📝 Remember Why It Mattered

* **Context Notes** – Right-click (or long-press) any day to jot down what happened. Had a great workout? Felt sick? Write it down.
* **Visual Reminder** – Little purple dots show which days have notes.

### 🎨 The Little Things

* **Dark by Default** – Because let's be honest, dark mode is better. (But you can switch if you want.)
* **Confetti!** – You get a little celebration when you complete something. It's silly but it works.
* **Make It Yours** – Resize the sidebar on desktop however you like.

* **Charts:** Recharts for the data viz, Canvas Confetti for the celebrations
* **Dates:** date-fns (because date logic is painful)
